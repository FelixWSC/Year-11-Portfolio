      <p>To start I started to lightly sketch my character, I knew I didn't want to do a really big realistic character so I decided on a cartoony knight character, I wanted it to almost look like a chess piece or a character from a tv show. When I made the character I didn't know how much detail I needed to add so I probably should have simplified it as to let me transfer it better into blender. I quite liked the front on view so I moved onto the side angle which was slightly tougher but I enjoyed making it. </p>

        The first function I made, its job is to create the floor gradient to create the illusion that the player is moving through the background and the pipes.

        How this works is that a loop scans through every square on the bottom row of our board. Each time it draws two overlapping squares, with one slighlty smaller square on top of another one to give the appearance of a slight oultline for the pixels. One square is always black, which finds its correct position with the (col * square_size, row * square_Size) parameters. Then the height and width is just the square_size. The other square and the main floor is drawn by creating an RGB value based on the valuse of col and row_count (which is constant) this creates a gradient from black to red for our floor.

      <h4>Person 1</h4>
      <p>What do you think of the floor gradient? Think it looks pretty cool, helps makes the game look like its moving.</p>
      <p> Do you think it matches the colour scheme of the game? Yeah, the black and red colour gradient looks good on the floor.
      </p>
      <h4>Person 2</h4>
      <p>Do you think the floor gradient looks good? Looks good and fits into the game very well.</p>
      <p>Do you think the colours of it match the rest of the game? Looks pretty cool the rest of the game looks amazing.</p>

      <h3>Development</h3>
      <p>My second functions job is to basically draw the columns. This second function I made called 'Draw_pipes', draws a column on the grid/board based on the column position and gap start variables, this creates a column at certain intervals on the grid giving us columns along our grid/board. </p>

      <p>How do the columns look in the game? They look good, you can clearly tell what they are, the only thing is to make sure the hit detection is consistant for them.</p>

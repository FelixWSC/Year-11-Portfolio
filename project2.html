    <h1> Overview of the project</h1>
    <p>For this group project, my group is going to be recreating Flappy Bird using Python’s pygame. Flappy Bird will be quite complex to make with lots of components and sections needed to create the game in its best possible version. In Flappy Bird, the player will control the bird to fly through and avoid the obstacles (the poles/columns) without touching the ground to try and get as far as possible and beat their high score. Our group will work together to create all the needed components like the ground, background, character, pipes/obstacles, score and more. </p>

<h1> End users</h1>
<p>The end users of our project will be mainly students and adolescents. Students and adolescents want to play an enjoyable game, that is fun to pass the time during school or free time, and that makes them feel accomplished when they play and beat their high scores. A key thing in making our users come back to our game is having a balanced difficulty, We want to make sure that the game is challenging for players so they won't get bored quickly, but we need to make sure the game isn’t too hard as people will be more likely to quit/not want to play the game, so we need to create that sweet spot to keep people playing. We also want the game to be appealing to the eye to draw in kids and other consumers, things like cool characters, obstacles, and colours. </p>

    <h1> Requirements</h1>
    <p> To make this game, many things are required. The main things are of course the different components such as the main character (the bird), the obstacles/pipes, and the other features like the ground and background. Other requirments we want to implament include things such as, a score so that the players can try to beat their highscore and possibly if we finish everything early try to add a menu or music or something of the likes.</p>

    <h1> Implications</h1> 
   <h3>Functionality</h3>
   <p>Part of the functionality is to make sure the player can move properly and that they not just falling. Another important thing is to make sure the program can quit properly.</p>
   <h3>Aesthetics</h3>
   <p>Make sure everything looks good, so that its not painful to the eyes. Correct colour scheme for floor, background and player are also very important for the game to work properly.</p>
   <h3>Future proofing</h3>
   <p>To make it easier for our future selves, we should make sure the code is well structured and well/correctly named. Another thing we should do is, while making code adding comments to clarify ceratin things in the code.</p>
